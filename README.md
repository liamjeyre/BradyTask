# BradyTask

To get started to develop the code you first need to initialise a local version of the database. 

This is done by using the command "dotnet ef database update" in the package manager console. 
If it says that the project cannot be found, add "--project {link to csproj file}" and this should fix it

That is all that is needed to start developing with the project. Happy coding!
